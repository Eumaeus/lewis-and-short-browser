# CITE Lewis & Short

A single-page web-application for navigating the [Lewis & Short Dictionary CITE Service](http://folio2.furman.edu/lex/). It draws data from a [SCS-Akka Microservice](https://github.com/cite-architecture/Server-CITE-App), (examples at <http://beta.hpcc.uh.edu/hmt/hmt-microservice/>).

The instance of the SCS-Akka service serving the *Lewis & Short* as a CITE Collection offers data from [an edition of the LSJ Lexicon](https://github.com/Eumaeus/cite_lsj_cex) formatted as a [CEX](https://cite-architecture.github.io/citedx/CEX-spec-3.0.1/) file, with the lexicon's entries formatted lightly in Markdown. The original digitization of the public domain text of the LSJ is courtesy of the [Perseus Digital Library](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/):  Text provided by Perseus Digital Library, with funding from The National Endowment for the Humanities.
